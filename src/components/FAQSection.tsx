          id: 'escrow-service',
          question: "What is an escrow service and how does it work?",
          answer: "Our escrow service protects both buyers and sellers by holding funds until both parties meet the agreed terms. The buyer deposits funds with us, the seller delivers the product or service, and funds are released once delivery or work is confirmed."
        },
        {
          id: 'why-escrow',
          question: "Why should I use escrow instead of paying directly?",
          answer: "Escrow reduces the risk of fraud. Funds are only released when the buyer confirms delivery or the inspection period lapses, ensuring trust and accountability."
        },
        {
          id: 'fund-holder',
          question: "Who holds the funds during a transaction?",

        },
        {
          id: 'transaction-types',
          question: "What types of transactions can I use this escrow service for?",
          answer: "Our platform supports both physical goods and services. For goods, we track delivery using a unique code. For services, we recommend breaking work into milestones for clarity and safety."

      faqs: [
        {
          id: 'release-payment',
          question: "When should I release payment to the seller?",
          answer: "You don't need to release manually unless you're satisfied early. After receiving the product and providing the delivery code, you have a 1-hour inspection window. If you confirm satisfaction earlier, payment is released instantly. If not, it auto-releases after the 1 hour."
        },
        {
          id: 'product-issues',
          question: "What if the product is not as described?",
          answer: "You can reject the item during inspection and initiate a return. Ensure your delivery person requests a return code from the seller before handing it back."
        },
        {
          id: 'disputes',
          question: "How do I report a dispute or problem?",
          answer: "Our platform minimizes disputes through automation. If unsatisfied, initiate a return within 1 hour after getting the delivery code. We only handle rare cases like item-switching during returns (with tamper-proof documentation) or service milestone disputes where buyers become unresponsive."
        },
        {
          id: 'cancel-transaction',
          question: "Can I cancel a transaction after payment?",
          answer: "Yes, but only if delivery hasn't started (item still 'waiting dispatch'). Once a courier is allocated, cancellation isn't possible. However, you can still initiate a return during the 1-hour inspection period after delivery."
        },
        {
          id: 'refund-proof',
          question: "What proof is required if I want a refund?",
          answer: "Refunds are only possible if you initiate a return within the 1-hour inspection window after delivery code verification. Ensure your delivery person requests a return code from the seller. No refunds are processed once the inspection window passes without a return request."
        }

      faqs: [
        {
          id: 'payment-timing',
          question: "When will I receive my payment?",
          answer: "Funds are released once the buyer confirms satisfaction or the 1-hour inspection window ends after code verification. If the buyer confirms instantly, funds are released immediately."
        },
        {
          id: 'buyer-refuses',
          question: "What if the buyer refuses to release payment unfairly?",
          answer: "Once the delivery code is verified and the 1-hour window passes without dispute, payment is auto-released. Buyers cannot hold funds indefinitely."
        },
        {
          id: 'no-delivery-code',
          question: "What if the delivery person fails to request the delivery code?",
          answer: "If no code is verified, we consider the delivery unverified. The buyer will be refunded, and the seller bears the loss. Always instruct your delivery person to request the code before handover."
        },
        {
          id: 'prove-delivery',
          question: "How do I prove delivery happened?",
          answer: "Only the correct input/verification of the delivery code counts as verified delivery. It triggers automatic status updates on our platform and protects you from false claims."
        },
        {
          id: 'item-switching',
          question: "Am I protected against item-switching during returns?",
          answer: "Yes, but only if you take proper steps. Attach a tamper-proof, signed document to the item at shipment. The buyer must co-sign during return. If they fail to co-sign, their claim is invalid. However, it's your responsibility to ensure this document is properly attached before dispatch."

          question: "How are users verified?",
          answer: "All users must register with valid email address and phone number. This ensures traceability and accountability in every transaction."
        },
        {
          id: 'payment-safety',
          question: "Is my payment information safe?",

        },
        {
          id: 'dispute-resolution',
          question: "How are disputes resolved, and how long does it take?",
          answer: "Our platform runs automatically with minimal human intervention. We only step in for item-switching during returns (with tamper-proof documentation) or service milestone disputes where buyers become unresponsive. All other transactions follow system rules with defined inspection windows."
        },
        {
          id: 'unresponsive-party',
          question: "What happens if one party becomes unresponsive?",
          answer: "If a buyer is unresponsive post-delivery and the code has been used, the system auto-releases funds. If a seller is unresponsive before shipping, the buyer can cancel and get a refund."
        },
        {
          id: 'documentation',
          question: "What documentation do I need in case of a dispute?",
          answer: "Clear images, communication history, signed documents (if provided), and delivery records are helpful. For services, email agreements and milestone confirmations matter."

          id: 'delivery-delays',
          question: "What happens if delivery is delayed?",
          answer: "Sellers must deliver within agreed timelines. If delivery hasn't started ('waiting dispatch'), buyers can cancel for a full refund. Once delivery begins with courier allocation, cancellation isn't possible. If items are never delivered and no code is verified, the system automatically refunds the buyer."
        },

          id: 'inspection-window',
          question: "What's the inspection window for physical goods?",
          answer: "Buyers have 1 hour after code retrieval to inspect goods. If no complaint is raised within this time, funds are automatically released."
